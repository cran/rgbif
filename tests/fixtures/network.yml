        System of Scientific Collections (DiSSCo)","description":"The Distributed
        System of Scientific Collections is a new world-class Research Infrastructure
        (RI) for natural science collections. The DiSSCo RI works for the digital
        unification of all European natural science assets under common curation,
        access, policies and practices, and aims to ensure that the data is easily
        Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR). As such, DiSSCo will
        transform a fragmented landscape of crucial natural science collections into
        an integrated knowledge base that provides interconnected hard evidence of
        the natural world. DiSSCo represents with 120+ collection holding institutions
        in 21 countries, the largest ever formal agreement between organisations of
        this type. These organisations join forces to develop and operate as a distributed
        Research Infrastructure. DiSSCo began its so-called Preparatory Phase in September
        2018 to develop a comprehensive Construction Masterplan, which will be followed
        by a construction phase. The RI will become fully operational in 2025. More
