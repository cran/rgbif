        - eBird Observation Dataset","description":"eBird is a collective enterprise
        that takes a novel approach to citizen science by developing cooperative partnerships
        among experts in a wide range of fields: population ecologists, conservation
        biologists, quantitative ecologists, statisticians, computer scientists, GIS
        and informatics specialists, application developers, and data administrators.
        Managed by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology eBird’s goal is to increase data
        quantity through participant recruitment and engagement globally, but also
        to quantify and control for data quality issues such as observer variability,
        imperfect detection of species, and both spatial and temporal bias in data
        collection. eBird data are openly available and used by a broad spectrum of
        students, teachers, scientists, NGOs, government agencies, land managers,
        and policy makers. The result is that eBird has become a major source of biodiversity
        data, increasing our knowledge of the dynamics of species distributions, and
        having a direct impact on the conservation of birds and their habitats.","type":"OCCURRENCE","hostingOrganizationKey":"e2e717bf-551a-4917-bdc9-4fa0f342c530","hostingOrganizationTitle":"Cornell

        partenaires, sur la flore, la fonge et les végétations-habitats. C’est réellement
        en 2010 avec le lancement de l’établissement du Format Standard de Données
        sur la flore (FSD Flore), conçu comme le « format commun de données de la
        Fédération des CBN », que la démarche a été initiée. Il s’en est suivi de
        nombreux échanges ayant permis de finaliser le format, de le tester sur les
        premiers jeux de données, d’établir une charte d’adhésion au projet et d’élaborer
        le cadrage final de l’exercice d’agrégation des données. Le projet s’est concrétisé
        au premier trimestre 2013 à travers la mise au format des données détenues
        par les CBN et leur intégration dans le Système d’Information de la FCBN (SI-Flore).
        A l’horizon de l’année 2014, il résulte, de ce projet structurant, que la
        FCBN dispose d’un système d’information d’envergure nationale et fort de plus
        de 20 millions de données d’observation sur la flore de France. Les données

        African Bird Atlas Project 2","description":"The Second Southern African Bird
        Atlas Project (SABAP2) is the most important bird conservation project in
        the region. It holds this status because all other conservation initiatives
        depend on the results of the bird atlas, to a greater or lesser extent. You
        cannot determine the conservation status of a species unless you know its
        range and how this is changing. So red-listing depends on the results of this
        project. So does the selection of sites and habitats critical to bird conservation.
        SABAP2 is the follow-up project to the Southern African Bird Atlas Project
        (for which the acronym was SABAP, and which is now referred to as SABAP1).
        This first bird atlas project took place from 1987-1991. The second bird atlas
        project started on 1 July 2007 and plans to run indefinitely. The current
        project is a partnership between the Animal Demography Unit at the University
        of Cape Town, BirdLife South Africa and the South African National Biodiversity
        Institute (SANBI). The project aims to map the distribution and relative abundance
        of birds in southern Africa and the atlas area includes South Africa, Lesotho
        and Swaziland. SABAP2 was launched in Namibia in May 2012.\n\nThe field work
        for this project is done by more than one thousand nine hundred volunteers,
        known as citizen scientists - they are making a huge contribution to the conservation
        of birds and their habitats. The unit of data collection is the pentad, five
        minutes of latitude by five minutes of longitude, squares with sides of roughly
        9 km. There are 17339 pentads in the original atlas area of South Africa,
        Lesotho and Swaziland, and a further 10600 in Namibia, 4900 in Zimbabawe and
        6817 in Kenya.\n\nAt the end of April 2016, the SABAP2 database contained
        more than 153,000 checklists. The milestone of eight million records of bird
        distribution in the SABAP2 database was reached on 14 April 2016, less than
        eight months after reaching seven million on 22 August 2015, which in turn
        was 10 months after the six million record milestone. It had taken two days
        less than a year to get from five million to six million, the fastest million
        records ever up to then. So doing a million in just less than eight months
        is awesome. More than 75% of the original SABAP2 atlas area (ie South Africa,
        Lesotho and Swaziland) has at least one checklist at this stage in the project''s
        development. More than 32% of pentads have four or more lists.\n\nThe most
        pressing data collection needs are to get coverage as complete as possible,
        and to try to build a foundation of four checklists per pentad. On top of
        this foundation the skyscraper of checklists can be built. Ideally, we would
        like checklists representing every month of the year. We would also like to
        have lots of checklists for each pentad in every year.\n\nThis dataset upload
        includes data from both the Full protocol submissions, as well as adhoc and
        incidental sightings that have been submitted to the project. Full Protocol
        submissions are done using a defined protocol, spatial and temporal. Adhoc
        and incidental (incid) sightings are single occurrence sightings within the
        same spatial resolution. The protocol type can be defined from the catalogNumber
        of each record.","type":"OCCURRENCE","hostingOrganizationKey":"dd862d06-e6e9-4ab9-bc86-c875cc148c1f","hostingOrganizationTitle":"Animal

        is a database that contains distributional data on the wild flora indigenous
        species, archeophytes and naturalised aliens) of Flanders and the Brussels
        Capital Region. It holds about 3 million records of vascular plants, dating
        from 1800 till present. Furthermore, it includes ecological data on vascular
        plant species, redlist category information, Ellenberg values, legal status,
        global distribution, seed bank etc. The database is an initiative of \"Flo.Wer\"
        (http://www.plantenwerkgroep.be), the Research Institute for Nature and Forest
        (INBO) (http://www.inbo.be) and the National Botanic Garden of Belgium (http://www.br.fgov.be).
        Florabank aims at centralizing botanical distribution data gathered by both
        professional and amateur botanists and to make these data available to the
        benefit of nature conservation, policy and scientific research. The occurrence
        data contained in Florabank1 are extracted from checklists, literature and
        herbarium specimen information. Of survey lists, the locality name (verbatimLocality),
        species name, observation date and IFBL square code - the grid system used
        for plant mapping in Belgium (Van Rompaey 1943) - are recorded. For records
        dating from the period 1972–2004 all pertinent botanical journals dealing
        with Belgian flora were systematically screened. Analysis of herbarium specimens
        in the collection of the National Botanic Garden of Belgium, the University
        of Ghent and the University of Liège provided interesting distribution knowledge
        concerning rare species, this information is also included in Florabank1.</p>\n<p>The
        data recorded before 1972 is available through the Belgian GBIF node (http://www.gbif.org/dataset/940821c0-3269-11df-855a-b8a03c50a862),
        not through Florabank1, to avoid duplication of information. A dedicated portal

        at: http://projects.biodiversity.be/ifbl.</p>\n<p>All data in Florabank1 is
        georeferenced. Every record holds the decimal centroid coordinates of the
        > IFBL square containing the observation. The uncertainty radius is the smallest
        circle possible covering the whole IFBL square, which can measure 1 km² or
        4 km². Florabank is a work in progress and new occurrences are added as they
        become available; the dataset will be updated through GBIF on a regularly

        integrated management of biodiversity data of the Azores, providing a large
        number of specialized services supporting research, policy and education.
        The 3000 visits per day, the numerous international scientific collaborations,

        prestigious databases demonstrate the Portal’s scientific quality as well

        archipelagos (the other being Madeira, Salvage Islands, the Canary Islands

        European INTERREG IIIB projects, an unprecedented collaboration of more than
        200 taxonomists and other scientists resulted in accurate and comprehensive
        lists of terrestrial species in the Canary Islands (Izquierdo et al., 2001,

        Real Jardín Botánico ha desarrollado y mantenido diversas bases de datos sobre
        las plantas de la Península Ibérica. Uno de los proyectos que se desarrollaron
        en el RJB en la década de 1990 consistió en extraer de la literatura los datos
        de distribución de plantas. En 1999, cuando esta base de datos contaba con
        aproximadamente 600.000 registros, se continuó el trabajo a través del programa
        ANTHOS, financiado por la Fundación Biodiversidad (Ministerio de Agricultura,
        Alimentación y Medio Ambiente) y el Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas
        - Real Jardín Botánico (Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad). Desde el
        año 2006 cuenta con una aplicación desarrollada sobre un sistema de información
        geográfica (SIG) que integra y mejora los procedimientos y consultas de la
        anterior, incrementa notablemente el conjunto de los datos disponibles —en
        la actualidad tenemos c. 1,8 millones—, hasta un horizonte de c. 3,5 millones
        de registros que estimamos para la bibliografía botánica de España. Además,
        la nueva aplicación combina la información corológica con otra de tipo cartográfico
        sobre variables ambientales y mapas de referencia, lo que permite localizar
        con mayor exactitud las citas de plantas, así como explicar de forma visual
        los patrones de distribución de las distintas especies. Se ha elegido como
        ámbito geográfico general del proyecto, la vista de la Península Ibérica e
        islas de la Macaronesia (Canarias, Madeira y Azores) como representación de

        Bird Surveys","description":"The Garden Bird Survey (GBS) has been run by
        the Canberra Ornithologists Group (COG) since 3 July 1981.  Summary results
        of the GBS are published by COG in the Annual Bird Report  published as an
        issue of \"Canberra Bird Notes\" in hard copy and on the COG website  http://cbn.canberrabirds.org.au/
        (navigate through the link to Canberra Bird Notes).\n\nThe basis of the Survey
        is a site equivalent in area to a circle of 100m in radius around the observer''s
        home or workplace.    Not all sites are circular but all are approximately
        3Ha in area.  There is no restriction on the elevation of the bird when observed,
        and birds flying over the site are included.\n\nMost of the Survey sites are
        located in the urban area of the ACT but some are also located in the City
        of Queanbeyan and the villages and rural residential areas in the areas of
        NSW surrounding the ACT.  A State indicator shows which sites are inside or
        outside the ACT.\n\n\n\nThe observation period is determined by standard starting
        dates for each year, with a year always commencing on 3 July.  In most cases
        the observation period is 7 days so that within each year the starting date
        of each period is the same day of the week.  Exceptions are:\n-\tIn Leap Years
        the period commencing February 26 is 8 days to accommodate the 29 February;
        and\n-\tEvery year the period beginning 25 June is 8 days to enable a seamless
        match to the first day of the week beginning 3 July.\nThe basic counting rule
        is to report the maximum number of birds of a species seen at any time during
        the week.  For example:\n-\tIf ten birds of species \"A\" are seen on the
        first day of a period and twelve on the second day, record \"12\".    \n-\tIf
        in the same period 4 birds of species \"B\" are seen on the second day and
        five birds of species \"B\" are seen on the sixth day report \"5\".  \n\nApplication
        of this rule means that the survey results are not appropriate for measuring
        the numbers of birds that are migrating in flocks since only the biggest flock
        is recorded with no measure of the number of flocks.\n\nIt should be noted
        that number of sites operating in any period may vary, both between years
        and within a year.   The number of sites tends to be low for the periods beginning
        3 and 10 July (due to delays in obtaining new Charts) and from 18 December
        to 8 January due to observers being away on vacation.","type":"OCCURRENCE","hostingOrganizationKey":"3c5e4331-7f2f-4a8d-aa56-81ece7014fc8","hostingOrganizationTitle":"Atlas

        for Biodiversity Genomics (CBG) at the University of Guelph is spearheading
        a novel approach to biodiversity research within Canada and internationally.
        Its three research units -- CBG Collections, CBG Genomics (or the Canadian
        Centre for DNA Barcoding, CCDB) and CBG Informatics -- are advancing 21st
        century biodiversity science by enabling species identification and discovery
        that is based on the analysis of sequence diversity in short, standardized
        gene regions, DNA barcodes. CBG Collections maintains a globally unique natural
        history collection of 3.3 million specimens. Every specimen is digitized,
        and the exact storage location of each specimen is tracked in a collection
        management information system for quick reference and retrieval. The databased
        information for every voucher is also archived in the Barcode of Life Data
        System (BOLD; www.boldsystems.org), permitting the permanent storage, validation
        and analysis of barcode sequence data and associated specimen metadata. Most
        (88.6%) of the specimens have been DNA barcoded, and a few representatives
        of every species have been digitally imaged. The CCDB holds high quality DNA
        extracts in a secure 2000 ft2 ultra-cold freezer bank. These DNA extracts
        reflect residual material following the barcode analysis of samples; it contains
        5.3 million extracts from over 250,000 species derived from 231 countries,
        oceans and dependent territories, all connected to a voucher specimen on BOLD.\n\nThis

        (2007 -2017)","description":"<p>Over the last decade, the Integrated Marine
        Observing System’s Animal Tracking Facility (IMOS ATF) has established a permanent
        array of acoustic receivers around Australia to detect the movements of tagged
        marine animals in coastal waters. Simultaneously, IMOS ATF developed a centralised
        national database (https://animaltracking.aodn.org.au/) to encourage collaborative
        research across the user community and provide unprecedented opportunities
        to quantify individual behaviour across a broad range of taxa. Here we present
        the database and quality control procedures developed to collate 48.5 million
        valid detections from 1891 receiving stations. This dataset consists of detection
        data for 3523 tags deployed on 117 species (fish, sharks, rays, reptiles,
        and mammals), with distances travelled ranging from a few to thousands of
        kilometres. This dataset of acoustic detections constitutes a valuable resource
        facilitating meta-analysis of animal movement, distributions, and habitat
        use, and is important for relating species distribution shifts with environmental
        covariates.</p>\n<p>This copy of the IMOS ATF data is of the valid detections

        This dataset has been summarized by reducing the detection records to the
        count of detections per animal per site per day (UTC). The DwC field eventId
        has been used to record the transmitter serial number. The initial deployment/release
