`rgbif` gives you access to data from [GBIF][] via their REST API. GBIF versions their API - we are currently using `v1` of their API. You can no longer use their old API in this package - see `?rgbif-defunct`.

Please cite rgbif. Run the following to get the appropriate citation for the version you're using:

```r
citation(package = "rgbif")
```

To get started, see:

* rgbif vignette (https://docs.ropensci.org/rgbif/articles/rgbif.html): an introduction to the package's main functionalities.
* Function reference (https://docs.ropensci.org/rgbif/reference/index.html): an overview of all `rgbif` functions.
* Articles (https://docs.ropensci.org/rgbif/articles/index.html): vignettes/tutorials on how to download data, clean data, and work with taxonomic names.
* Occurrence manual (https://books.ropensci.org/occurrences/): a book covering a suite of R packages used for working with biological occurrence data.

Check out the `rgbif` [paper][] for more information on this package and the sister [Python][pygbif] and [Ruby][gbifrb] clients.

Note: Maximum number of records you can get with `occ_search()` and `occ_data()` is 100,000. See https://www.gbif.org/developer/occurrence
