rgbif 0.6.0
===============

BUG FIXES

* A number of variables changed names to better follow the Darwin Core standard. `latitude` is now `decimalLatitude`. `longitude` is now `decimalLongitude`. `clazz` is now `class`. Code in this package changed to accomodate these changes. `date` is now `eventDate`. `georeferenced` is now `hasCoordinate`. Beware of these changes in your own code using `rgbif` - find and replace for these should be easy.
* Changed `altitude` parameter in `occ_search()` to `elevation` - should have been `elevation` the whole time. 
* `occ_count()` function with parameter changes: `nubKey` parameter in changed to `taxonKey`. New parameter `protocol`. Parameter `catalogNumber` gone. Parameter `hostCountry` gone. These parameters are still in the function definition, but if called they throw a useful warning telling you the correct parameter names. (#76)
* Fixed bug in `name_lookup()` function that was labeling facet outputs incorrectly. (#77)

IMPROVEMENTS

* Better checking and parsing of response data from GBIF: Across all functions, we now check that the response content type is `application/json`, then parse JSON ourselves using `RJSONIO::fromJSON` (instead of httr doing it).
* Across all functions, we now return all potenital character class columns as character class (instead of factor), by passing `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` to all `data.frame()` calls.
* Now using assertthat package in various places to give better error messages when the wrong input is passed to a function.
* Four parameters have name changes in the `occ_search()` function. These parameters are still in the function definition, but if called they throw a useful warning telling you the correct parameter names. (#75)
* Updated docs in `name_usage`, `name_backbone`, `name_lookup`, and `name_suggest` functions. 
* `sourceId` parameter in `name_usage()` function doesn't work so error message is thrown when used.

NEW FEATURES

* New function `check_wkt()` to check that well known text string is the right format. (#68)
* New dataset typestatus to look up possible specimen typeStatus values. See #74 for more information.
* GBIF added some new parameters for use in the `occ_search()` function. `scientificName`: search for a species by name (instead of `taxonKey`). `continent`: search by continent. `lastInterpreted`: search by last time GBIF modified the record. `recordNumber`: search by the data collector's specimen record number - this is different from the GBIF record number. `typeStatus`: search by specimen type status. (#74)
* Note that given the new parameters many more options are available for implicit faceted search in which you can pass many values in a vector to do multiple searches like `parameterName = c(x, y, z)`. These parameters are: `taxonKey`, `scientificName`, `datasetKey`, `catalogNumber`, `collectorName`, `geometry`, `country`, `recordNumber`, `search`, `institutionCode`, `collectionCode`, `decimalLatitude`, `decimalLongitude`, `depth`, `year`, `typeStatus`, `lastInterpreted`, and `continent`. This isn't faceted search server side - this is just looping your different values of the parameter against the GBIF API.
* Range queries are a new feature in the GBIF API. Some parameters in `occ_search()` now support range queries: `decimalLatitude`,`decimalLongitude`,`depth`,`elevation`,`eventDate`,`lastInterpreted`,`month`, and `year`. Do a range query for example by `depth=50,100` to ask for occurrences where depth was recorded between 50 and 100 meters. Note that this syntax `depth=c(50,100)` will perform two separate searches, one for `depth=50` and one for `depth=100`. (#71)

rgbif 0.5.0
===============

IMPROVEMENTS

* Changed name of country_codes() function to gbif_country_codes() to avoid conflicts with other packages.
* Replaced sapply() with vapply() throughout the package as it is more robust and can be faster.
* Added a startup message to the package.
* gbifmap() now plots a map with ggplot2::coord_fixed(ratio=1) so that you don't get wonky maps.
* occ_count() now accepts a call to query publishingCountry with a single parameter (country), to list occurrence counts by publishing country.
* occ_get() and occ_search() lose parameter minimal, and in its place gains parameter fields, in which you can request fields='minimal' to get just name, taxon key, lat and long. Or set to 'all' to get all fields, or selection the fields you want by passing in a vector of field names.

BUG FIXES

* Updated base url for the GIBF parser function parsenames()
* isocodes dataset now with documentation.

NEW FEATURES

* New function count_facet() to do facetted count search, as GBIF doesn't allow faceted searches against the count API.
* New function elevation() to get elevation data for a data.frame of lat/long points, or a list of lat/long points. This function uses the Google Elevation API (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/elevation/).
* New function installations() to get metadata on installations.

rgbif 0.4.1
===============

BUG FIXES

* Improved handling of limit parameter in occ_search() so that the correct number of occurrences are returned.
* Fixed various tests that were broken.

IMPROVEMENTS

* Added missing limit argument in datasets() function man file, also function gains start and callopts parameters. 

rgbif 0.4.0
===============

IMPROVEMENTS

* Data object isocodes gains new column gbif_names, the GBIF specific names for countries.
* Added in deprecation messages throughtout package for functions and arguments that are deprecated.
* tests moved to tests/testthat from inst/tests.
* Vignettes now in vignettes/ directory.

NEW FEATURES

* New function dataset_suggest(), a quick autocomplete service that returns up to 20 datasets.
* New function name_backbone() looks up names against the GBIF backbone taxonomy.
* New function name_suggest(), a quick autocomplete service that returns up to 20 name usages.
* New function occ_metadata() to search dataset metadata.
* New function parsenames() that parses taxonomic names and returns their components.

rgbif 0.3.9
===============

IMPROVEMENTS

* Added back in functions, and .Rd files, from old version or rgbif that interacts with the old GBIF API.
* Updated vignette to work with new GBIF API and fxns.

NEW FEATURES

* Added functions to interact with the new GBIF API, notably: country_codes(), dataset_metrics(), dataset_search(), datasets(), name_lookup(), gbifmap(), gist(), name_lookup(), name_usage(), networks(), nodes(), occ_count(), occ_get(), occ_search(), organizations(), stylegeojson(), togeojson(). See the README for a crosswalk from old functions to new ones. 

BUG FIXES

* test files moved from inst/tests/ to tests/testthat/

rgbif 0.3.2
===============

BUG FIXES

* Removed georeferencedonly parameter - is deprecated in the GBIF API


rgbif 0.3.0
===============

IMPROVEMENTS

* Added S3 objects: Output from calls to occurrencelist() and occurrence list_many() now of class gbiflist, and output from calls to densitylist() now of class gbifdens. 
* Slight changes to gbifmaps() function.
* url parameter in all functions moved into the function itself as the base GBIF API url doesn't need to be specified by user. 
* Vignette added.

NEW FEATURES

* Added function country_codes() to look up 2 character ISO country codes for use in searches.
* Added function occurrencelist_many() to handle searches of many species. 
* Added functions togeojson() and stylegeosjon() to convert a data.frame with lat/long columns to geojson file format, and to add styling to data.frames before using togeojson() . 
* occurrencelist() and occurrencelist_many() gain argument fixnames, which lets user change species names in output data.frame according to a variety of scenarios.
* taxonsearch() gains argument accepted_status to accept only those names that have a status of accepted. In addition, this function has significant changes, and examples, to improve performance.


rgbif 0.2.0
===============

IMPROVEMENTS

* Improved code style, and simplified code in some functions.

NEW FEATURES

* occurrencelist() now handles scientific notation when maxresults are given in that form.
* occurencelist() now can retrieve any number of records; was previously a max of 1000 records. 

BUG FIXES

* Demo "List" was returning incorrect taxon names - corrected now. 
* Removed unused parameter 'latlongdf' in occurencelist().


rgbif 0.1.5
===============

IMPROVEMENTS

* Changed all functions to use RCurl instead of httr as httr was presenting some problems.
* Two function, capwords and gbifxmlToDataFrame, added with documentation as internal functions. 

NEW FEATURES

* Added function densitylist to access to records showing the density of occurrence records from the GBIF Network by one-degree cell.
* Added function gbifmap to make a simple map to visualize GBIF data.
* Added function occurrencecount to count taxon concept records matching a range of filters.

NEW FEATURES 

* released to CRAN
