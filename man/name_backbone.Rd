\title{Lookup names in the GBIF backbone taxonomy.}
\usage{
name_backbone(name, rank = NULL, kingdom = NULL, phylum = NULL,
  class = NULL, order = NULL, family = NULL, genus = NULL,
  strict = FALSE, verbose = FALSE, start = NULL, limit = 100, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{(character) Full scientific name potentially with authorship (required)}

\item{rank}{(character) The rank given as our rank enum. (optional)}

\item{kingdom}{(character) If provided default matching will also try to match against this
if no direct match is found for the name alone. (optional)}

\item{phylum}{(character) If provided default matching will also try to match against this
if no direct match is found for the name alone. (optional)}

\item{class}{(character) If provided default matching will also try to match against this
if no direct match is found for the name alone. (optional)}

\item{order}{(character) If provided default matching will also try to match against this
if no direct match is found for the name alone. (optional)}

\item{family}{(character) If provided default matching will also try to match against this
if no direct match is found for the name alone. (optional)}

\item{genus}{(character) If provided default matching will also try to match against this
if no direct match is found for the name alone. (optional)}

\item{strict}{(logical) If TRUE it (fuzzy) matches only the given name, but never a
taxon in the upper classification (optional)}

\item{verbose}{(logical) If TRUE show alternative matches considered which had been rejected.}

\item{start}{Record number to start at. Use in combination with limit to page through results.
Note that in \code{\link{occ_search}} we do the paging internally for you, so there's no
\code{start} parameeter, but in other functions you have to do paging yourself.}

\item{limit}{Number of records to return. Defaults: For \code{\link{occ_search}} 500, for others
100. Maximum: 1,000,000 records for \code{\link{occ_search}}, others, don't know yet.}

\item{...}{Further named parameters, such as \code{query}, \code{path}, etc, passed on to
\code{\link[httr]{modify_url}} within \code{\link[httr]{GET}} call. Unnamed parameters will
be combined with \code{\link[httr]{config}}.}
}
\value{
A list for a single taxon with many slots (with \code{verbose=FALSE} - default), or a
list of length two, first element for the suggested taxon match, and a data.frame
with alternative name suggestions resulting from fuzzy matching (with \code{verbose=TRUE}).
}
\description{
Lookup names in the GBIF backbone taxonomy.
}
\details{
If you don't get a match GBIF gives back a list of length 3 with slots synonym,
confidence, and matchType='NONE'.

\examples{
\dontrun{
name_backbone(name='Helianthus annuus', kingdom='plants')
name_backbone(name='Helianthus', rank='genus', kingdom='plants')
name_backbone(name='Poa', rank='genus', family='Poaceae')

# Verbose - gives back alternatives
name_backbone(name='Helianthus annuus', kingdom='plants', verbose=TRUE)

# Strictness
name_backbone(name='Poa', kingdom='plants', verbose=TRUE, strict=FALSE)
name_backbone(name='Helianthus annuus', kingdom='plants', verbose=TRUE, strict=TRUE)

# Non-existent name - returns list of lenght 3 stating no match
name_backbone(name='Aso')
name_backbone(name='Oenante')

# Pass on httr options
library('httr')
name_backbone(name='Oenante', config=timeout(1))
